================================================= OverQuaked Tutorial =================================================
Here's how to play my mod :3
When the game loads in you will see many healing stations on the wall. These are your cooking stations!
If you click on a cooking station, a hungry customer appears! Each customer prefers a type of food, but you can cook any of the recipes avaliable.
There are crates containing all the ingredients you need. They aren't labeled, but they go in this order:
    1) Tomato
    2) Bread
    3) Cheese
    4) Lettuce
    5) Flour
    6) Sugar
    7) Eggs
    8) Milk
    9) Berries
    10) Beef
You can walk up to a crate to pick up your ingredients. Be careful not to pick up the wrong combination or you will lose.
The 5 recipes and the ingredients to make them are:
    1) Pizza: tomato, bread, cheese
    2) Burger: bread, cheese, lettuce, beef
    3) Cake: flour, sugar, eggs, milk
    4) Salad: tomato, lettuce, berries
    5) Smoothie: milk, berries
Once you have gathered all your ingredients, you may go up to a cooking station to prepare the food. You must click and hold the button until it turns red.
Now you have a happy customer :) and the ingredients will respawn so you can server the next one!
Thanks for playing >w<
